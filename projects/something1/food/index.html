                    <p>Ta'meya and ful mudammas, which are essentially fava beans and falafel are the original Egyptian fast-foods. They're a staple of the Egyptian diet, mainly because they're filling and use ingredients that are
                        easily accessible in the country. The ful is made of fava beans that are cooked for hours in a pot called a qedra. The ta-meya, which is an Egyptian falafel, is made out of crushed fava beans that is later
                        made into a paste, then fried. Nowadays you can find falafels all over the Middle East however, Egypt is the actual origin of those delightful fried treats. A perfect dish for all you vegos!
